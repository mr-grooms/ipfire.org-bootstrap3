	<h4>What is IPFire?</h4>
	<p>
		IPFire is a Linux-based operating system which focuses on its purpose being a firewall system and
		also flexible to act as a server system. It is completely free as it is licensed under the
		<a href="#XXX">GNU General Public License</a> in version 3.
	</p>

	<h4>What makes IPFire special?</h4>
	<p>
		We believe in the power of flexibility. People are only as powerful as their environment is.
		With IPFire, the access to the internet is fast, easy and secure at the same time which in
		return influences everbody's life.

		<div id="concept">
			<p>
				The foundation of <strong>IPFire</strong> is the high level of flexibility which lets us
				configure different versions of this operating system out of a single base. Beginning with a
				few megs big firewall system it is possible to run IPFire as a file server or VPN gateway for
				staff, branches and customers. This is manageable with the packet manager that enhances
				the system only if you really want to.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe that this is the best way to provide security to a network. There is no way to give
				out a static appliance as is because security is not a single thing to install and never touch
				again. It's a kind of process paired with behaviour and restrictions. This plans could look
				different from company to company and also differ from the place IPFire is installed at.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Please click through the tabs and take a look at what possibilities IPFire offers for
				your personal concept of network. And don't be scared. We have built-in our own to
				start with...</em>

			<img src="{{ static_url("images/icons/security.png") }}" class="floatTL" alt="{{ _("Security") }}" />
			<p>
				The matter that counts most in the development of IPFire is - of course - security. But
				we don't believe that there is only one single way to achvieve security. It is more important
				that every administrator knows about what he is configuring and that he is teached about what
				is right in his special environment.

			<p>
				From the technical point of view, IPFire is a very shrinked and hardened firewall system
				which comes with an integrated package manager that is called <a href="/features/pakfire">Pakfire</a>.
				With only a single click you can extend your system to a server that provides services from different
				categories.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most interesting addons:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<!-- XXX make this right -->
				<li>File services like: Samba and vsftpd</li>
				<li>A collection of command line tools like: tcpdump, nmap and traceroute.</li>
				<li>Asterisk</li>
				<li><em>{{ _("and many more...") }}</em></li>

		<div id="firewall">
			<img src="{{ static_url("images/icons/firewall.png") }}" class="floatTL" alt="{{ _("Firewall") }}" />
			<p>
				IPFire comes with a SPI (stateful inspection) firewall which is built on top of the
				Linux <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/">netfilter</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the installation of IPFire, the network gets seperated into different parts that
				represent a special kind of computers with their own level of security:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="color: green;">
					<strong>Green:</strong> The segment of the network which is marked by the colour <em>green</em>,
					which stands for a safe area, is where all client computers get. It is the normal LAN and normally
					wired. Clients can access all other segments without any restriction.
				</li>
				<li style="color: red;">
					<strong>Red:</strong> The internet as a source of danger gets the colour <em>red</em>.
					No access from the internet is permitted to pass the firewall.
				</li>
				<li style="color: darkblue;">
					<strong>Blue:</strong> The wireless LAN is an other source of potential harm. So it is seperated
					and got the colour <em>blue</em> for "air". Clients on this part of the network must be
					allowed explicitely to access the internet.
				</li>
				<li style="color: orange;">
					<strong>Orange:</strong> If there are any servers that are accessable by the internet, it is
					also possible to take them over. For this case, there is the segment coloured <em>orange</em>
					(some compromise between red and green) so that those machines are not able to harm any
					other segment. This is called demilizarized zone (DMZ).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br class="clear" />
			<p>
				So there is a best place for every machine in the network. All the segments can be activated seperately
				(except green and red are always required).
				<br />
				On top of all of that, there is an <strong>outgoing firewall</strong> for filtering the egress direction.

		<div id="vpn">
			<img src="{{ static_url("images/icons/vpn.png") }}" class="floatTL" alt="{{ _("VPN") }}" />
			<p>
				IPFire can be enhanced to a VPN (virtual private network) gateway that connects places and
				persons to the local network. This could either be staff, friends and people you want to share
				data with in a secure way but also could be a branch office, important customer or an other
				company you are operating with.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be able to dock on diffent technologies IPFire offers these implementations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>IPSec</strong> to connect networks side-by-side (also is called net-to-net).</li>
				<li>To connect so called <em>roadwarrior clients</em> there is <strong>OpenVPN</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- XXX there is too less margin on the buttom of this list, so: -->
			<br class="clear" />
			<p>
				Those implementations let IPFire connect to routers or VPN gateways by:
				<a href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco</a>, <a href="http://www.juniper.net">Juniper</a>,
				other Linux-based implementations and many more...

		<div id="hardware">
			<img src="{{ static_url("images/icons/hardware.png") }}" class="floatTL" alt="{{ _("Hardware") }}" />
			<p>
				Based on a recent version of the Linux kernel 2.6 series, IPFire supports latest hardware
				like 10G network cards and wireless hardware out of the box.
			</p>
			<p>
				Developers are concerned about keeping the system running on many variations as
				possible what makes IPFire run on cheap hardware as well as running on high
				performance servers.

		<div id="virtualization">
			<img src="{{ static_url("images/icons/virtualization.png") }}" class="floatTL" alt="{{ _("Virtualization") }}" />
			<p>
				IPFire can be run as a virtual guest on the following hypervisors:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org">KVM</a>/Qemu</li>
				<li>Xen (paravirtualized and fully virtualized mode)</li>
				<li>VMWare (Workstation, vSphere, ESXi, ...)</li>
				<li>Virtualbox</li>
			</ul>
			<br class="clear" />
			<p>
				It brings many frontend drivers for high performnce for all the hypervisors.

		<div id="itsfree">
			<img src="{{ static_url("images/icons/itsfree.png") }}" class="floatTL" alt="{{ _("It's free") }}" />
			<p>
				As IPFire is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General
				Public License</a> in version 3 it is free of charge.

				There is the opportunity to make a <a href="/donation">donation</a> to the
